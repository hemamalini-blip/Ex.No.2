Define the Use Case:
Select a specific task for evaluation across platforms (e.g., summarizing a document, answering a technical question, or generating a creative story / Code).
Ensure the use case is applicable to all platforms and will allow for comparison across response quality, accuracy, and depth.
Create a Set of Prompts:
Prepare a uniform set of prompts that align with the chosen use case.
Each prompt should be clear and precise, ensuring that all platforms are evaluated using the same input.
Consider multiple prompts to capture the versatility of each platform in handling different aspects of the use case.
Run the Experiment on Each AI Platform:
Input the prompts into each AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) and gather the responses.
Ensure the same conditions are applied for each platform, such as input format, time to respond, and prompt delivery.
Record response times, ease of interaction with the platform, and any technical issues encountered.
Evaluate Response Quality:
Assess each platform’s responses using the following criteria: Accuracy,Clarity,Depth,Relevance 
Compare Performance:
Compare the collected data to identify differences in performance across platforms.
Identify any platform-specific advantages, such as faster response times, more accurate answers, or more intuitive interfaces.
Deliverables:
A comparison table outlining the performance of each platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) based on accuracy, clarity, depth, and relevance of responses.
A final report summarizing the findings of the experiment, including recommendations on the most suitable AI platform for different use cases based on performance and user 

### Output:


AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

Scenario:
Final Prompt

Step 1: Summarize the following 500-word article on “The Basics of Blockchain Technology” in 120–150 words. The summary should be clear, structured, and beginner-friendly, suitable for undergraduate students who may not have prior exposure to blockchain. Use simple technical language to explain the concept while maintaining accuracy.

Step 2 (Feedback): Revise the summary to make it even simpler and more engaging. Include at least two real-world examples of blockchain applications (e.g., cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and supply chain tracking systems). Ensure that the explanation highlights the definition, working principles, key features, and advantages of blockchain in a concise way.

Additional Requirements:

Create a mind map of the key concepts of blockchain technology, covering:

Definition
Working Principles
Features (decentralization, security, transparency, immutability)
Applications (finance, healthcare, supply chain, voting systems, etc.)
Generate at least two high-quality images that visually explain:

How blockchain works (block structure, linking with cryptographic hash, distributed ledger).
Real-world applications of blockchain in different industries.
Dynamic Style Guidance:

Present the content in a step-by-step, engaging, and technical yet beginner-friendly manner.
Use short paragraphs, clear flow, and logical connections between concepts.
Highlight blockchain’s impact, limitations, and future potential to give students a dynamic understanding of the topic.

Step 1 – Summary (120–150 words, clear & beginner-friendly)

Blockchain technology is a digital system used to record, verify, and store transactions securely. Instead of relying on one central authority, it works on a decentralized network of computers (nodes) where every transaction is grouped into a “block.” Each block is linked to the previous one using cryptographic hashes, forming a chain that is nearly impossible to alter. This structure makes blockchain transparent, secure, and tamper-resistant.

Key features include decentralization (no single owner), immutability (data cannot be changed once stored), transparency (everyone can view transactions), and security (protected through encryption). Blockchain is widely used in financial transactions, supply chain management, and healthcare record systems.

Although it provides benefits like reduced fraud, efficiency, and cost savings, it also faces challenges such as energy consumption, scalability issues, and regulatory uncertainties. Still, blockchain holds great promise for reshaping digital trust and data management.

Step 2 – Revised Simpler Version with Real-World Examples

Blockchain is like a digital notebook that is shared by many computers around the world. Instead of one company controlling it, everyone in the network helps check and confirm the information. Once data is written in this notebook (a “block”), it is locked and connected to the previous block, making a secure “chain.”

This system is decentralized (no single controller), transparent (everyone can see records), and secure (hard to hack). For example, in Bitcoin, blockchain records who owns and transfers money without needing a bank. In the supply chain, companies like Walmart use it to track food from farms to stores, ensuring safety and trust.

Blockchain reduces fraud, lowers costs, and speeds up processes. But it also uses a lot of energy and struggles with handling huge amounts of data. Despite these challenges, it is becoming a powerful tool for finance, healthcare, voting, and more. ChatGPT Image Aug 21, 2025, 11_35_48 AM Mindmap (Text Format)
